The main objective of the project RecruMax is to
provide a platform between the Job Seekers and Job Providers
facilitating an exam portal and filtration of candidates. This project
RecruMax automates activities like conducting the exam for
applied candidates and giving the results. It will help in eliminating
the inefficient candidates and at the same time it provides the
ability to choose the best and suitable candidates for the required
jobs.
The existing system has manual processing which
takes more time to filter the candidates by conducting the exams,
preparing the questions and answers for it and processing the
results. This project RecruMax can accomplish the work in a short
period of time.
